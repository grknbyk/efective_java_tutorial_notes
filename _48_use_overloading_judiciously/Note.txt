		// compile time da belirleniyor. Yanlış yönlendirebilir.
		// It is bad practice to write code whose behavior is likely to confuse programmers
		// Therefore you should avoid confusing uses of overloading.
		
		
		
		
		// Notes
		// not have to overloaded methods have the same number of parameter
		
		
		// ObjectOutputStream
		
		// create different and specif methods. instead of bunch of write methods; writeLong, writeRead etc..
			//ObjectOutputStream writeInt - writeLong etc.. therefore readInt, readLong etc..
